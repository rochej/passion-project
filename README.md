Goldstar is a chore-tracking web app made for the Naked Lady House in San Francisco, CA.

Our system is simple--do chores, get points, get paid.  The problem--housemates are inconsistent about writing down their chores in the accounting book.  Enter Goldstar, a simple web interface to enter chores into the system.

#Features:

##Main Page:
See other roommates' stats and enter what you've done

No user authentication is required because:
- It's tedious
- We trust one another
- Who'd log on to give someone else points?

##Monthly:
See how much money to doll out at the end of the month.  Our monthly budget it $50, split among all chore doers.

##10%:
Ten Percent is going above and beyond the day-to-day maintenance of the house.  Make cheesecake?  Reorganize the deep-storage?  Text it to the 10% number and it shows up on the 10% page for all to appreciate.

#Use It:
Fork it and make it your own!  Tell me all about it.  Custom house data is added in the seed file.
